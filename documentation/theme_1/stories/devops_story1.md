"As a developer, I want to automate the build process, so I can quickly and reliably create builds for testing and deployment."

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The automated build process should be able to fetch the latest code from the source code repository.
2. The build process should compile the code without any errors and generate a build package.
3. The build package should contain all necessary files for deployment, including executable files, libraries, configuration files, and any other required files.
4.The build process should be triggered automatically on every code commit to the repository.
5. The build process should be able to integrate with any existing continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
